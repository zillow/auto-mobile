# Plans - Syntax

## General Format

The main components are `name` and `steps`, where each item in `steps` is a tool call.
```yaml
---
name: launch-clock-app
description: Very simple test to launch Clock app
steps:
  - tool: launchApp
    appId: com.google.android.deskclock
    label: Launch Clock application

  - tool: stopApp
    appId: com.google.android.deskclock
```

## Full Syntax

Set up demo mode with 1pm time and 4G connectivity. This tends to make AutoMobile's view hierarchy cache highly efficient
as there are fewer changes between screenshots given the same screen. It is highly recommended to include this in every
AutoMobile plan.

TODO: Add gradle property to always set demo mode as well as a CLI flag on executePlan.

```yaml
  - tool: enableDemoMode
    time: "1300"
    mobileDataType: "4g"
    mobileSignalLevel: 4

    batteryPlugged: false
    label: Enable demo mode with 1pm time and 4G connectivity
```
