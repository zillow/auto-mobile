# AutoMobile

AutoMobile is a comprehensive set of tools that enables AI agents to interact with mobile devices. It provides automated
testing, performance monitoring, and device interaction via an MCP server, custom test runner, and agentic loop that is
compatible with multiple foundation model providers. The first platform supported is Android with plans to extend to iOS.

# Why build this

Mobile engineers have a hard time having high confidence when simple changes can have cascading consequences. The UI 
tests meant to provide confidence are slow, brittle, and generally expensive to run. Product owners and designers have a
tough time dogfooding mobile apps on both platforms. Accessibility audits require experts in mobile accessibility - and
after 15 years weâ€™re still applying WCAG once a quarter.

Basically everyone is missing something and it comes down to ease of access. It turns out there are low level tools that
have been available and open sourced for years.
