# Test Execution - Overview

## Environments

If you haven't already, add [AutoMobile JUnitRunner dependency](junitrunner.md).

#### Local

Right-click on the test created in Android Studio and run. See other [execution options](options.md).

#### CI

Read the [guide](ci.md)

## Performance

Ensure that the [accessibility service](../architecture.md#android-accessibility-service) has been installed and running
on the target device. AutoMobile will eventually automate this setup but for now it needs to be done manually.
