# Model Providers

AutoMobile comes equiped with an agent primarily accessible via its JUnitRunner. It will stay bundled with the JUnitRunner
unless we find usecases to make it a more general component. It is generally able to access most of the top model providers
with an architecture for extensibility as needed. The main goal of this agent is to provide extremely easy access to use
the provider that meets your needs.
