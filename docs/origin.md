Mobile engineers have a hard time having high confidence when simple changes can have cascading consequences. The UI
tests meant to provide confidence are slow, brittle, and generally expensive to run. Product owners and designers have a
tough time dogfooding mobile apps on both platforms. Accessibility audits require experts in mobile accessibility - and
after 15 years weâ€™re still applying WCAG once a quarter.

Basically everyone is missing something and it comes down to ease of access. It turns out there are low level tools that
have been available and open sourced for years.
