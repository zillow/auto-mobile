# Plans - Overview

AutoMobile needed a way to record and playback tool calls in order to provide reproducible results. Plans are how the
project is standardizing and versioning its specific tool capabilities while delivering on general tool capabilities. 

# Using Plans

Work through [authoring your first test](first-plan-and-test.md) as an initial guide.

After that 
* Read about options to [export](export-plan.md) plans.
* See [the full syntax](syntax.md) for documentation on every possible part of AutoMobile plans.
