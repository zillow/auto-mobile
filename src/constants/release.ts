/**
 * Release constants - DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY
 *
 * This file contains release-specific constants that are updated automatically.
 * The values below are defaults for local development.
 *
 * The APK checksum is updated by the merge workflow when the accessibility
 * service APK changes. The release workflow verifies the checksum matches
 * the built APK before publishing.
 *
 * During CI/CD release builds, the release version is replaced via
 * scripts/generate-release-constants.sh
 *
 * For local development, RELEASE_VERSION "latest" fetches from the most recent
 * GitHub release, and the empty checksum skips verification (not recommended for production).
